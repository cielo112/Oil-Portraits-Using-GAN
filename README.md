# Oil-Portraits-Using-GAN
This repository showcases a GAN-based solution that creates oil portraits from scratch. Through extensive training on a diverse collection of art, this AI-powered system learns to generate portraits that embody the essence of classical oil painting techniques and artistic expression. The paintings generated are a bit abstracted in form since we were only able to run the neural network for 200 epochs given limitations to hardware resources. Regardless, the outcome still showcases the posibility of generating oil paitings using machine learning tools.
